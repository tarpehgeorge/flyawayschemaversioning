## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install Flyway by following the instructions in the blog post.
- Configure the flyway.conf file with your Databricks connection details.
- Place your migration scripts in the sql directory.
- Run the Flyway migrations using the commands mentioned in the blog post.


## CI/CD Integration

To automate the database migration process as part of your CI/CD pipeline, you can use the [Flyway GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/flyway-migrate). It's important to note that the GitHub Action currently doesn't expose the full list of configurations. However, you can use the official [Flyway Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/flyway/flyway) image to customize the CI flow according to your specific requirements."# flyawayschemaversioning"
